Creating Reusable send mail functionality

Detailed explanation of sendMail.js:
- Implemented a reusable email sending function using nodemailer and dotenv for environment variables.
- Configured nodemailer to use Gmail's SMTP server, with authentication details (email and password) loaded from .env.
- The createTransporter function sets up the transporter with the provided configuration.
- The sendMail function verifies the transporter and sends an email using the given message options, logging success or error.

Process for setting up email and password in .env:
- In your .env file, you set EMAIL and PASSWORD for authentication with Gmail's SMTP server.
- To get the password, you must generate an "App Password" from your Google Account (not your regular email password).
- Steps:
  1. Go to your Google Account settings.
  2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled.
  3. Navigate to Security > App Passwords.
  4. Generate a new app password for "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or your platform).
  5. Copy the generated password and set it as PASSWORD in your .env file.
- This app password allows your Node.js app to send emails securely without exposing your main account password.
