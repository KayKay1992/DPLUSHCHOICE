Users Page Explanation:

The Users page is a React component designed for managing user accounts in an admin dashboard. It features a modern, responsive design with a gradient background (slate to purple) and glassmorphism effects using Tailwind CSS.

Key Components:
- Header: Displays "Users" title with gradient text and a subtitle "Manage user accounts and permissions".
- Stats Cards: Four cards showing metrics - Total Users, Active Users, Admins, and Inactive Users - each with icons and dynamic counts from the data array.
- Data Table: Uses MUI X-DataGrid to display user information in columns: ID, User (username and email), Phone, Role (colored badges for Admin/Moderator/User), Status (green for Active, red for Inactive), and Actions (delete button with trash icon).
- Styling: Custom sx props for DataGrid ensure high-contrast colors, centered text, hover effects, striped rows, and a custom scrollbar. All elements are responsive and use Tailwind classes for layout.

The page includes sample user data (8 users) and supports pagination, checkbox selection, and sorting. Icons from React Icons (FaTrash, FaUser, etc.) enhance the UI.
