Step-by-Step: Implementing the Navbar Component

1. **Create Navbar Component File**
  - Created `Navbar.jsx` in `frontend/src/components/`.

2. **Import Required Packages**
  - Imported React hooks (`useState`) for menu state.
  - Imported icons from `react-icons/fa` for search, user, hamburger, and close icons.
  - Imported MUI's `ShoppingBasketIcon` and `Badge` for the basket icon and badge.

3. **Setup Responsive State**
  - Used `useState` to manage mobile menu open/close state.

4. **Build Navbar Layout**
  - Used a flex container for horizontal layout.
  - Placed logo and brand name on the left (brand name hidden on small screens).
  - Added a hamburger menu button for mobile screens.
  - On desktop, displayed search bar, basket icon, and login button.
  - On mobile, only logo, search, and login are shown in the menu (basket and brand name hidden).

5. **Style with Tailwind CSS**
  - Applied a beautiful gradient background using Tailwind (`bg-gradient-to-r from-fuchsia-400 via-sky-300 to-emerald-300`).
  - Used rounded corners, shadows, and opacity for a modern look.
  - Added hover and transition effects for interactivity.

6. **Implement Mobile Menu**
  - Toggled mobile menu with hamburger/close icons.
  - Mobile menu displays search and login only, stacked vertically.

7. **Export Component**
  - Exported the Navbar as default for use in the app.

This approach ensures the Navbar is visually appealing, fully responsive, and user-friendly on all devices.
