Banners Page Implementation:

The Banners page is a React component for managing promotional banners in the admin dashboard. It features a modern, responsive design with glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds.

Key Components:
- Header: Gradient title "Banners" with subtitle for banner management.
- Stats Cards: Four cards displaying Total Banners, Active Banners, Inactive Banners, and Views Today with dynamic counts and icons.
- Active Banners Section: Left side with a list of banner cards, each containing a thumbnail image, title, description, active status badge, and delete button.
- Add New Banner Section: Right side with a form including drag-and-drop upload area, title input field, description textarea, and gradient add button.

The page uses sample banner data for three products (perfume, wristwatch, handbag) with working Unsplash images. Each banner card has a solid slate background for optimal readability, rounded corners, and hover effects. The layout is fully responsive, stacking vertically on mobile and displaying side-by-side on larger screens.
