Implemented order controller functionality:
 - createOrder: Handles creating a new order from request data and saving it to the database.
 - updateOrder: Updates an existing order's details using its ID and request data.
 - deleteOrder: Deletes an order from the database by its ID and returns confirmation.
 - getUserOrders: Retrieves all orders for a specific user, sorted by creation date.
 - getAllOrders: Fetches all orders in the database, sorted by creation date.

Registered order controller route:
 - Defined RESTful routes for order operations and linked them to the corresponding controller functions.
 - Imported and registered the order route in app.js to handle order-related API requests.
