ORDER CONFIRMATION PAGE MODIFICATION ADDITION OF VIEW ORDER BUTTON - December 20, 2025

Modified the order confirmation page to replace the "Continue Shopping" button with a "View Your Orders" button for better user experience.

================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

After placing an order, users were navigated to the order confirmation page (/myorders) which had a "Continue Shopping" button. However, users might want to view their order history or manage their orders instead of continuing to shop immediately.

================================================================================

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

Replaced the "Continue Shopping" button with a "View Your Orders" button that navigates users to their account page where they can view all their orders, track order status, and access review functionality.

================================================================================

TECHNICAL CHANGES:

File Modified: Frontend/src/pages/Order.jsx

Change Details:
- Replaced the "Continue Shopping" button with "View Your Orders" button
- Updated navigation target from "/" (home page) to "/myaccount" (user account page)
- Maintained the same styling and user experience design
- Preserved all button functionality and hover effects

================================================================================

CODE CHANGES:

BEFORE:
```jsx
{/* Continue Shopping Button */}
<div className="text-center pt-4">
  <button
    onClick={() => navigate("/")}
    className="bg-linear-to-r from-pink-500 to-purple-500 hover:from-pink-600 hover:to-purple-600 text-white font-bold px-8 py-4 rounded-full shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300 transform hover:scale-105 text-lg w-full"
  >
    Continue Shopping
  </button>
</div>
```

AFTER:
```jsx
{/* View Your Orders Button */}
<div className="text-center pt-4">
  <button
    onClick={() => navigate("/myaccount")}
    className="bg-linear-to-r from-pink-500 to-purple-500 hover:from-pink-600 hover:to-purple-600 text-white font-bold px-8 py-4 rounded-full shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300 transform hover:scale-105 text-lg w-full"
  >
    View Your Orders
  </button>
</div>
```

================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT:

1. **Better Navigation Flow**: After order completion, users are directed to view their orders rather than back to shopping
2. **Order Management Access**: Direct access to order tracking, reviews, and account management
3. **Reduced Friction**: Eliminates the need for users to manually navigate to their account to check order status
4. **Consistent Experience**: Aligns with the expectation that post-purchase, users want to see their order details

================================================================================

INTEGRATION POINTS:

- **Stripe Success URL**: After successful payment, users are redirected to /myorders (Order component)
- **MyAccount Component**: The destination page where users can view all orders and access review functionality
- **Order History**: Users can see order status, track deliveries, and leave reviews
- **Review System**: Seamless access to review products from completed orders

================================================================================

TESTING CONSIDERATIONS:

1. **Navigation Flow**: Verify button correctly navigates to /myaccount
2. **User Authentication**: Ensure protected route works correctly
3. **Order Display**: Confirm orders are properly loaded and displayed
4. **Review Access**: Verify review buttons work for completed orders
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure button works on all device sizes
