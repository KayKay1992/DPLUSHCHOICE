Implemented user controller functionality:
- updateUser: Updates user details, including hashing the password if changed, and saves the updated user to the database.
- deleteUser: Deletes a user from the database using their ID and returns a confirmation message.
- getUserById: Retrieves a single user by ID, excluding the password field from the response.
- getAllUsers: Fetches all users from the database, excluding their passwords, and returns the list.

Registered user controller route:
- Defined RESTful routes for user operations and linked them to the corresponding controller functions.
- Imported and registered the user route in app.js to handle user-related API requests.
