Frontend UI Updates (Banner + Footer + About/Contact)
Date: Feb 2026

Goal
1) Banner section
- When "Shop Now" is clicked, navigate to the Products page.
- Update the displayed phone number to: +2347040334276

2) Footer section
- Create an About Us page and navigate to it from the footer.
- Create a Contact Us page and navigate to it from the footer.
- Navigate to Products page when clicking Products in the footer.
- Update footer email to: dplushchoice@gmail.com

3) Contact Us page
- Add the social media links (Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, Facebook).


1) Banner: Shop Now → /products and phone update
File updated
- frontend/src/components/Banner.jsx

What changed
- Imported useNavigate from react-router-dom.
- Created navigate = useNavigate() inside the Banner component.
- Added an onClick handler to both "Shop Now" buttons (fallback banner + API banner) so they do:
	navigate("/products")
- Updated "Call Us" text to show the new phone number:
	+2347040334276

Why
- This keeps navigation inside React Router (no page reload) and ensures the CTA always takes the user to the product listing.


2) Created About Us page
File added
- frontend/src/pages/AboutUs.jsx

What it contains
- A simple About Us page with project styling and a short description.


3) Created Contact Us page
File added
- frontend/src/pages/ContactUs.jsx

What it contains
- Business address
- Email link:
	mailto:dplushchoice@gmail.com
- Phone link:
	tel:+2347040334276
- Social media icons/links (same links as the footer):
	- Instagram
	- TikTok
	- WhatsApp
	- Facebook


4) Wired routes for About/Contact
File updated
- frontend/src/App.jsx

Routes added
- /about → AboutUs
- /contact → ContactUs


5) Footer: make links navigate correctly + update email
File updated
- frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx

What changed
- Replaced the old Quick Links anchor tags (href="#") with React Router <Link>.
- Mapped Quick Links to routes:
	Home → /
	About Us → /about
	Contact Us → /contact
	Products → /products
	Categories → /products
- Updated footer email display to:
	dplushchoice@gmail.com

Why
- href="#" does not navigate anywhere.
- Using React Router <Link> gives correct navigation without reload.


How to verify
1) Open the homepage and click Banner "Shop Now" → it should go to /products.
2) Scroll to the footer:
	- Click About Us → /about
	- Click Contact Us → /contact
	- Click Products → /products
3) On Contact Us page, confirm:
	- Email is dplushchoice@gmail.com
	- Phone is +2347040334276
	- Social icons open the correct links.
