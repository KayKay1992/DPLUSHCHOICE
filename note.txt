Building Announcement component and adding TypeWriter

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create the Announcement Component**
	- Navigate to `frontend/src/components/`.
	- Create a new file named `Announcement.jsx`.
	- Define a functional React component called `Announcement`.
	- Add a container with Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., background, padding, rounded corners, shadow, flex alignment).

2. **Install Typewriter Animation Package**
	- Open a terminal in the `frontend` directory.
	- Run: `npm install react-simple-typewriter`
	- This installs the `react-simple-typewriter` package for animated text effects.

3. **Import and Use Typewriter in the Component**
	- At the top of `Announcement.jsx`, import `{ Typewriter }` from `react-simple-typewriter`.
	- Use the `<Typewriter />` component inside your announcement message to animate text (e.g., cycling through phrases).

4. **Enhance with Tailwind CSS**
	- Apply Tailwind utility classes to style the announcement bar (e.g., gradients, icons, spacing, font styles).
	- Optionally, add a modern icon (SVG or emoji) for visual appeal.

5. **Export and Use the Component**
	- Export the `Announcement` component from `Announcement.jsx`.
	- Import and render it in your main page (e.g., `App.jsx` or a relevant route/component).

6. **Test the Announcement**
	- Start the development server: `npm run dev` (from the `frontend` directory).
	- Verify the animated announcement bar appears and cycles through the desired messages.

This process results in a modern, animated announcement bar using React, Tailwind CSS, and react-simple-typewriter.
