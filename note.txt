Generate Token and store in cookies:

1. Used the jsonwebtoken library to generate a JWT token after successful user authentication.
2. Created the token with user-specific payload and a secret key, setting an expiration time for security.
3. Utilized the cookie-parser middleware to store the generated token in an HTTP-only cookie, which is sent to the client and protected from JavaScript access.
4. On subsequent requests, the server reads the token from the cookie to verify user identity and authorize access to protected routes.

This approach secures user sessions and enables stateless authentication in the application.

Files changed and what was done:
- Backend/utils/generatetoken.js: Created a utility function to generate JWT tokens using user data and a secret key. Exported this function for use in authentication routes.
- Backend/app.js: Imported and used cookie-parser middleware to handle cookies. Integrated the generatetoken utility in authentication flow to issue tokens after login.
