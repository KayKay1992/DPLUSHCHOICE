Creating welcome email service

Welcome Email Service Implementation (D' Plush Choice)

1. **Purpose:**
	- Automatically sends a branded welcome email to new users when their status is `0` (not yet welcomed) in the database.
	- The email includes a personalized greeting, brand colors, and the company logo.

2. **Core Files:**
	- `EmailServices/sendWelcomeEmail.js`: Main logic for fetching users and sending emails.
	- `helpers/sendMail.js`: Handles Nodemailer configuration and sending.
	- `templates/welcome.ejs`: EJS template for the email body, styled with gradients and logo.
	- `assets/logo.jpg`: Logo image attached inline in the email.

3. **How It Works:**
	- The service queries the database for users with `status: 0` (new users).
	- For each user, it renders the `welcome.ejs` template using EJS, passing the user's name for personalization.
	- The email is constructed with:
	  - `from`: Company email address (from `.env`)
	  - `to`: User's email address
	  - `subject`: "Welcome to D' Plush Choice"
	  - `html`: Rendered EJS template
	  - `attachments`: Logo image (`logo.jpg`) attached as an inline image with `cid:logo`
	- The logo is referenced in the template as `<img src="cid:logo" ... />`.
	- The email is sent using Nodemailer via Gmail SMTP, with credentials loaded from `.env`.
	- After sending, the user's status is updated to `1` to prevent duplicate emails.

4. **Key Features:**
	- **Branding:** Uses a purple-magenta gradient, custom fonts, and a circular logo for a modern look.
	- **Personalization:** Greets the user by name and provides a friendly, welcoming message.
	- **Inline Logo:** Ensures the logo displays in most email clients by attaching it as an inline image.
	- **Error Handling:** Logs errors if email sending fails, so issues can be tracked.

5. **Technical Details:**
	- The logo attachment uses an absolute path: `path.resolve(__dirname, "../assets/logo.jpg")` for reliability.
	- The EJS template is rendered asynchronously for each user.
	- The service can be triggered manually or via a scheduled background job (e.g., with node-cron).

6. **Best Practices:**
	- Store sensitive credentials in `.env` and never commit them to source control.
	- Use Gmail App Passwords for secure SMTP authentication.
	- Test emails in multiple clients to ensure branding and images display correctly.
