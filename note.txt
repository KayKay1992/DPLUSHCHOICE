- Uses React state (showAll) and window resize listener for dynamic behavior.
- Maintains all animations and hover effects for visible categories.

SideMenu.jsx Implementation Details
-----------------------------------

1. Component Structure:
   - SideMenu.jsx is a functional React component designed for small screens (mobile/tablet) to display categories in a slide-in menu.
   - It imports React and defines the same categories array as Category.jsx for consistency.
   - The component takes props: isOpen (boolean to show/hide), onClose (function to close the menu).

2. Overlay and Positioning:
   - Uses fixed positioning with full screen blurred overlay (bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm) that closes the menu on click.
   - The menu slides in from the left with transform translate-x-0/-translate-x-full and smooth transition.
   - Hidden on large screens (lg:hidden) since it's for small screens.

3. Menu Design:
   - Gradient background from white via pink-50 to purple-50 with rounded right corners (rounded-r-3xl).
   - Glassmorphism effect with backdrop-blur-sm and semi-transparent elements.
   - Logo and gradient text header for branding.

4. Categories Display:
   - Each category in a glassmorphism card (bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm) with hover scale, shadow, and color transitions.
   - Larger images (w-14 h-14) with overlay effect on hover.
   - Arrow icon for navigation feel.
   - Staggered animation delay for fade-in effect.

5. Call-to-Action:
   - Gradient button at the bottom with hover effects and scale transform.

6. Integration:
   - To use: Import SideMenu in your Navbar or Home component.
   - Add state for isOpen (useState), and a hamburger button to toggle it.
   - Example: <SideMenu isOpen={isMenuOpen} onClose={() => setIsMenuOpen(false)} />
   - Ensure the hamburger menu is visible on small screens in Navbar.jsx.
   - Updated Navbar.jsx to include hamburger button and SideMenu component.

7. Responsiveness:
   - Only shows on screens smaller than lg (1024px).
   - Smooth animations and transitions for better UX.

This modern side menu features glassmorphism, gradients, and interactive hover effects, providing a luxurious and engaging mobile experience.
