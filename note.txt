Implemented protect middleware in all main routes:
- Imported the protect middleware from auth.middleware.js into each route file.
- Applied protect to critical endpoints in product, banner, user, order, auth, and AI routes to ensure only authenticated users can access these operations.
- This secures all sensitive API endpoints and enforces authentication across the backend.
