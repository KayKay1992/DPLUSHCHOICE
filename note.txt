Introduction to Background services.
Scheduling Task using node crone.

Background Services Setup:
- Installed express for server setup, dotenv for environment variable management, mongoose for MongoDB connection, and node-cron for scheduling background tasks.
- Initialized the app in index.js by importing required packages, configuring dotenv, and creating an Express app instance.
- Set up index.js to schedule background tasks using node-cron and start the server on the specified port from .env.
- Connected to MongoDB in db.js using mongoose, with connection details loaded from environment variables and automatic retry on failure.

Detailed Background Services Setup:

1. Installed Packages:
- express: Sets up the server and handles HTTP requests.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file for configuration (e.g., PORT, DB connection string).
- mongoose: Connects to MongoDB and manages database operations.
- node-cron: Schedules and runs background tasks at specified intervals.

2. App Initialization (index.js):
- Imported required packages and configured dotenv to access environment variables.
- Created an Express app instance to serve as the entry point for background services.
- Defined the PORT using process.env.PORT from the .env file.

3. Scheduling Background Tasks (index.js):
- Used node-cron to schedule a task that runs every second ("* * * * * *").
- The scheduled function logs a message and is the placeholder for any background logic (e.g., sending emails, cleaning up data, syncing with external APIs).
- The services function encapsulates the scheduling logic and is called during initialization.

4. MongoDB Connection (db.js):
- Used mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database using the DB connection string from environment variables.
- The connectDB function attempts to connect and logs a success message; on failure, it logs the error and retries after 5 seconds.
- The connection is established when the Express app starts listening on the specified port.

5. .env File:
- Stores sensitive configuration such as PORT and DB connection string, keeping them out of source code for security and flexibility.

This setup allows you to run scheduled background services in Node.js, with robust database connectivity and environment-based configuration, ready for scalable automation tasks.
