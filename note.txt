ADMIN ORDERS PAGE – SHOW NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE

1) What you requested
- On the Admin Orders page, you wanted:
	- Customer “name” column title changed to just “Name”
	- Show each order’s Address
	- Show each order’s Phone number

2) What I changed (Admin)
File: admin/src/pages/Orders.jsx
- Updated the DataGrid columns:
	- Renamed the header of the existing `name` field from “Customer Name” to “Name”.
	- Added a new `phone` column (shows `order.phone` or “-” if missing).
	- Added a new `address` column (shows `order.address` or “-” if missing).

3) Where the data comes from (Backend)
File: Backend/models/order.model.js
- The Order schema already contains:
	- `name` (String)
	- `phone` (String)
	- `address` (String)
So admin can display them directly as long as the order record has those fields saved.

4) Why some old orders may show “-”
- If an order was created before you started saving address/phone (or if a particular checkout flow didn’t provide them), then that order document won’t have `phone`/`address` values, so the admin table shows “-”.
