Created banner controller functionality:


Detailed explanation of banner.controller.js:
- createBanner: Receives banner data from the request, creates a new Banner document, saves it to the database, and responds with success or error.
- deleteBanner: Finds a banner by its ID from the request parameters, deletes it from the database, and returns a confirmation or error message.
- getAllBanners: Retrieves all banner documents from the database and returns them in the response, or an error if none are found.
- getRandomBanner: Fetches all banners, selects one at random, and returns it in the response, or an error if none are found.

- Developed banner controller to manage banner operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting banners.
- Each controller function handles validation, interacts with the database, and returns appropriate responses for banner actions.

Created banner routes:
- Defined RESTful routes for banner operations (e.g., POST /banners, GET /banners, GET /banners/:id, PUT /banners/:id, DELETE /banners/:id).
- Linked each route to its corresponding controller function to process requests and responses.

Registered banner route in app.js:
- Imported the banner route module and registered it with the Express app to handle all banner-related API requests.
- Ensured the route is accessible and properly integrated with middleware for authentication and error handling if required.
