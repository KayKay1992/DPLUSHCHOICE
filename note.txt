### Cart Integration Changes Explanation

#### Overview
The following changes were made to implement stock validation, user feedback via toasts, and ensure consistent toast display across the application for the cart functionality in the D'Plush Choice e-commerce frontend.

#### 1. Stock Validation in Product Addition
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/ProductDetails.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Product.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added logic to check available stock before adding products to cart.
  - If the total quantity (existing in cart + new quantity) exceeds stock, show an error toast: "Only X items available in stock. You already have Y in your cart."
  - Prevents over-adding items beyond available stock.
- **Purpose**: Ensures users can't add more items than available, providing immediate feedback.

#### 2. Stock Validation in Cart Quantity Updates
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Cart.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `handleQuantityChange` to check stock before allowing quantity increases.
  - If new quantity exceeds stock, show error toast with the same message format.
  - Added success toast for successful quantity updates: "Quantity updated successfully!"
- **Purpose**: Maintains stock integrity when users modify cart quantities directly.

#### 3. Toast Display Fixes
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Cart.jsx`, `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `ToastContainer` to `Cart.jsx` to display toasts on the cart page.
  - Added global `ToastContainer` to `App.jsx` to ensure toasts appear immediately on any page, preventing delayed display on navigation.
- **Purpose**: Fixes the issue where success toasts for adding products were showing on the cart page instead of the page where the action occurred.

#### 4. Configuration Files
- **File Added**: `frontend/jsconfig.json`
- **Changes**:
  - Configured JavaScript language service with ES2015 target and lib to resolve TypeScript-like errors in JS files.
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper JavaScript intellisense and error handling without strict TypeScript checks.

#### Summary
These changes enhance the user experience by:
- Preventing invalid cart states (over-stock additions).
- Providing clear, immediate feedback via toasts on the correct pages.
- Ensuring robust stock management across add and update operations.
- Maintaining consistent UI behavior with global toast handling.

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code patterns.
