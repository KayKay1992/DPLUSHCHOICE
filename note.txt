1. Created the main project folder and organized it into Backend, Frontend, Admin, and BackgroundServices directories for clear separation of concerns.

2. Initialized npm in the Backend folder to manage dependencies and scripts.

3. Installed essential backend packages:
	- Express: for building the RESTful server and handling API routes.
	- Mongoose: for interacting with MongoDB and defining data models.
	- Nodemon: for automatic server restarts during development.

4. Developed the server in app.js/index.js using Express, setting up middleware, routes, and basic error handling.

5. Established a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, including configuration for connection strings and handling connection events (success/error).

6. Used Nodemon to run the server, enabling live-reloading for efficient development.

This backend setup provides a scalable foundation for building the perfume, beauty, and jewelry ecommerce platform, supporting product management, user authentication, and order processing.
