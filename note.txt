ADMIN ORDERS: SEARCH BY ORDER ID
===============================

Goal
----
Allow the admin to quickly find any order using its Order ID directly from the Orders page.


Where it was implemented
------------------------
- Admin UI: admin/src/pages/Orders.jsx
- Backend API (already existed):
	- GET /api/V1/orders          (load all orders)
	- GET /api/V1/orders/:id      (fetch a single order by MongoDB ObjectId)


How the search works (two modes)
--------------------------------
The search input supports both “partial search” and “exact search”.

1) Partial search (filters the table)
- As the admin types into the “Search by Order ID” input, the page filters the already-loaded orders list.
- It checks whether each order’s `_id` includes the typed text.
- This is fast and does not call the backend.

Example:
- If an order ID is: 6760b4d5d8c1a2f07d3a9c11
- Typing: 6760b4 will filter the table to show matching rows.

2) Exact search (fetch by full Order ID)
- If the admin pastes a full MongoDB ObjectId (24 hex characters) and presses Enter / clicks “Search”, the page tries to fetch that exact order.
- This uses the API route:
	- GET /api/V1/orders/:id
- If the order exists, the table switches to show only that single order.
- If not found, an error toast is shown: “Order not found (check the Order ID)”.

Why exact search is needed:
- If your database has many orders, loading/filtering all orders might be heavy.
- Exact search allows you to fetch one order by ID directly.


UI behavior
-----------
- The Orders header area contains:
	- An input: “Search by Order ID”
	- A “Search” button
	- A “Clear” button

- Clear button:
	- Clears the search input
	- Resets the table back to showing all orders

- While an exact search request is running:
	- The page sets `isSearching` true
	- The table shows a loading state


Important requirement: CORS + cookies
-------------------------------------
Because the admin runs on a different origin (example: http://localhost:5175) and the backend uses cookie auth, the backend must:
- Allow the admin origin in CORS
- Use `credentials: true`
- Ensure the auth cookie is not blocked in local development


Quick test steps
----------------
1) Open Admin → Orders
2) Copy an order’s `_id`
3) Paste it into the search input
4) Press Enter / click Search
5) Confirm the table shows that one order
6) Click Clear to return to the full list
