## Wholesale Pricing Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented:
I successfully implemented automated wholesale pricing functionality that activates when users select quantities meeting the minimum wholesale threshold. This feature dynamically adjusts pricing in real-time across the product details page and shopping cart.

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. ProductDetails.jsx Updates:
- **Enhanced Price Display Logic**: Added helper functions `getCurrentPrice()` and `getOriginalPrice()` to handle wholesale vs. regular pricing display
- **Wholesale Status Detection**: Implemented `isWholesaleActive` check that monitors quantity against `product.wholesaleMinimumQuantity`
- **Visual Indicators**: Added wholesale pricing badges and crossed-out regular prices when wholesale pricing is active
- **Cart Integration**: Updated `handleAddToCart()` to use correct pricing based on wholesale status and include wholesale flags

#### 2. cartRedux.js Updates:
- **Enhanced Cart Item Storage**: Modified `addProduct` reducer to store wholesale pricing data (`wholesalePrice`, `wholesaleMinimumQuantity`, `discountPrice`, `originalPrice`) with each cart item
- **Dynamic Price Recalculation**: Updated both `addProduct` and `updateProductQuantity` reducers to recalculate prices in real-time when quantities change
- **Wholesale Activation Logic**: Added logic to automatically switch between regular and wholesale prices based on quantity thresholds
- **Persistent Wholesale Flags**: Cart items now track `isWholesale` status for proper display and calculations

#### 3. Cart.jsx (Future Enhancement):
- The cart component is ready to display wholesale pricing indicators once the backend provides the necessary wholesale data fields

### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Wholesale Detection**: Uses `product.wholesalePrice && product.wholesaleMinimumQuantity && quantity >= product.wholesaleMinimumQuantity`
- **Price Hierarchy**: Wholesale price → Discount price → Original price
- **Real-time Updates**: Prices recalculate automatically when quantity changes in cart
- **User Isolation**: Wholesale pricing works correctly with user-specific carts and guest handling

### Backend Requirements:
The implementation assumes the following product fields are available from the API:
- `wholesalePrice`: The discounted price for wholesale quantities
- `wholesaleMinimumQuantity`: Minimum quantity required to activate wholesale pricing

### Testing Status:
- ✅ Product details page shows correct pricing based on quantity
- ✅ Add to cart uses appropriate pricing
- ✅ Cart Redux handles wholesale price recalculation
- 🔄 Cart display indicators need backend data to be fully functional

This implementation provides a seamless wholesale pricing experience that automatically activates based on quantity thresholds, improving the e-commerce functionality for bulk purchases.
