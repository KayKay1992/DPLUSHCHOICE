HOME PAGE PRODUCT DISPLAY (RESTRUCTURE)
======================================

Goal
----
Make the products displayed on the Home page cleaner and more refined:
- Better spacing and responsive layout
- Consistent product card height/structure
- Less clutter on each card
- Show a curated number of products on Home (instead of everything)


What changed (Frontend)
-----------------------

1) Home page now uses a “Home variant” of the products grid
File: frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx

- Before:
	- Home rendered: <Products /> (showing the full products grid behavior)

- After:
	- Home renders:
		- <Products isHome limit={8} />

Effect:
- Home shows a cleaner grid with only the first 8 products.
- Full catalog behavior is still available on the Products page.


2) Products grid supports a home layout + optional limiting
File: frontend/src/components/Products.jsx

New props added:
- isHome (boolean)
	- When true, uses a tighter grid suitable for the Home page.
- limit (number)
	- When isHome is true, only renders the first N items (default 8).
- showLoadMore (boolean)
	- Controls whether the “Load More Products” button renders.

Layout changes:
- Home grid uses:
	- 2 columns on small screens
	- 3 columns on medium screens
	- 4 columns on large screens
	- tighter spacing (gap-4 / gap-6)

Note:
- The placeholder “Load More Products” button is hidden by default (it only appears if showLoadMore={true}).


3) Product card made cleaner and more consistent
File: frontend/src/components/Product.jsx

Improvements:
- Reduced the image height (cleaner card proportions)
- Removed the non-functional “Quick View” and “❤️” overlay buttons (less clutter)
- Made the card layout more consistent by using flex-column and pushing the Add-to-Cart button to the bottom
- Updated the category badge mapping to match your actual categories:
	perfumes, body-sprays, diffusers, scented-candles, necklace, earrings, rings, wristwatches,
	anklets, bracelets, bangles, bags, clutch-purse, jewelry-set, other-accessories


How to adjust
-------------
- To show more products on Home:
	- Change limit={8} to limit={12} (or any number) in Home.jsx.
