Dropdown Fix Explanation - December 20, 2025

What I did:
I modified the navbar dropdown in frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx to improve its hover behavior.

Problem:
The dropdown was closing prematurely when users tried to move their cursor from the username trigger to the dropdown menu options. This happened because the mouse events were handled separately on the trigger and dropdown areas.

Solution:
1. Simplified the mouse event handling by using a single wrapper div that contains both the username trigger and the dropdown menu
2. Removed the 100ms delay that was causing flickering
3. Removed separate mouse events from the dropdown menu itself
4. Now the dropdown opens when hovering over the username and stays open as long as the cursor is anywhere within the dropdown area (trigger or menu)
5. The dropdown only closes when the mouse completely leaves both the trigger and menu areas

Result:
The dropdown now behaves like standard web dropdowns - it stays open as long as the cursor is on it, allowing smooth navigation to the "My Account" and "Logout" options.

Navbar Dropdown Integration Explanation - December 20, 2025

How I integrated the dropdown in the navbar:

1. **State Management**:
   - Added `isUserDropdownOpen` state using React's `useState` hook to control dropdown visibility
   - Initially set to `false` (closed)

2. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - The navbar checks if `currentUser` exists (user is logged in)
   - If logged in, shows the user dropdown area instead of the login button

3. **Dropdown Structure**:
   - Created a wrapper div with `relative` positioning to contain both trigger and menu
   - Added mouse event handlers: `onMouseEnter` to open, `onMouseLeave` to close
   - Used CSS classes for smooth transitions and positioning

4. **Trigger Element**:
   - Displays user icon (FaUser), username, and a chevron icon that rotates when open
   - Made clickable with cursor pointer styling
   - Shows user's name or username from Redux state

5. **Dropdown Menu**:
   - Positioned absolutely with `top-full right-0` to appear below and aligned right
   - Uses conditional classes for opacity and visibility transitions
   - Contains two menu items: "My Account" (links to /myaccount) and "Logout" (calls handleLogout)
   - Each menu item has hover effects and proper spacing

6. **Styling & UX**:
   - Used Tailwind CSS for responsive design and smooth animations
   - Added shadow, border, and rounded corners for modern appearance
   - Implemented proper z-index to ensure dropdown appears above other content
   - Added transition effects for opening/closing animations

7. **Integration Points**:
   - Connected to Redux for user state management
   - Uses React Router for navigation to MyAccount page
   - Includes logout functionality that clears user state and redirects to home

My Account Page Creation Explanation - December 20, 2025

How I created the My Account page:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Created as a functional React component using hooks
   - Located at `frontend/src/pages/MyAccount.jsx`
   - Uses React Router for navigation and Redux for state management

2. **State Management**:
   - `activeTab`: Controls which section (profile/orders) is displayed
   - `orders`: Stores fetched order data from API
   - `loading`: Shows loading state while fetching data
   - Connected to Redux for currentUser state

3. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Checks if user is logged in on component mount
   - Redirects to login page if not authenticated
   - Uses protected route pattern

4. **API Integration**:
   - Fetches user orders using `userRequest.get(/orders/find/${currentUser._id})`
   - Handles loading states and error cases with toast notifications
   - Uses try/catch for robust error handling

5. **UI Layout**:
   - **Header**: Welcome message with gradient text styling
   - **Sidebar**: User profile info, navigation tabs, and logout button
   - **Main Content**: Tabbed interface switching between Profile and Orders

6. **Profile Tab Features**:
   - Displays user avatar (icon-based), name, and email
   - Shows placeholder fields for phone and address (not implemented yet)
   - Clean card-based layout with icons for each field
   - "Edit Profile" button (UI only, functionality not implemented)

7. **Orders Tab Features**:
   - **Loading State**: Spinner animation while fetching orders
   - **Empty State**: Encouraging message with "Start Shopping" button when no orders
   - **Order Cards**: Each order displayed in a card with:
     - Order ID (shortened), date, and status badge
     - Item count and total price
     - Product thumbnails with titles and quantities
     - Responsive grid layout for product images

8. **Styling & Design**:
   - Used Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and backdrop blur effects
   - Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
   - Pink/purple color scheme matching the brand
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Glassmorphism design with semi-transparent backgrounds

9. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - Order history display with product images
   - Status indicators (Completed/Pending)
   - Price formatting in Nigerian Naira
   - Date formatting for order creation dates
   - Product image display in order cards
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Logout functionality from the sidebar

10. **Technical Implementation**:
    - Axios for API calls with proper error handling
    - React Toastify for user notifications
    - Redux for global state management
    - React Router for navigation
    - Custom utility functions for formatting (formatPrice, formatDate)
