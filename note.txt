Implemented AI description generator feature:
- Created ai.model.js to define a schema for storing AI-generated product descriptions.
- Developed ai.controller.js to handle requests, receive title and image, call the AI API, and return a generated description.
- Set up ai.route.js with a POST endpoint for admins to submit a title and image, using multer for image upload.
- Registered the AI route in app.js to make the description generation endpoint available at /api/v1/ai/description.
