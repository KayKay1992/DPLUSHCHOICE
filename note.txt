Creating Category Component

Category.jsx Implementation Details
-----------------------------------

1. Component Structure:
   - Category.jsx is a functional React component that displays a grid of product categories for the e-commerce site.
   - It imports React and defines a categories array with objects containing name and image path for each category.
   - The component returns a section element with a background gradient and max-width container for layout.

2. Background and Heading:
   - The section has a subtle background gradient from pink-50 to white for a luxurious feel.
   - A centered heading "Shop by Category" uses a gradient text effect (pink to purple) for visual appeal.
   - A subtitle "Discover luxury in every detail" adds context.

3. Category Grid:
   - Uses CSS Grid with responsive columns: 2 on mobile, 3 on small screens, 4 on medium, 5 on large.
   - Each category is a card with hover effects: shadow increase, translate up, and scale.
   - Staggered fade-in animation using Framer Motion (initial opacity 0, y:50, animate to opacity 1, y:0).

4. Card Design:
   - Each card has an image container with aspect ratio, using img tag for the category image.
   - Luxury gradient overlay from black/90 to transparent for text readability.
   - Sparkling border effect on hover with ring and offset.
   - Category name at bottom with drop shadow, and a "Explore Collection" text that appears on hover.
   - Subtle shine effect at the top that slides in on hover.

5. Hover Effects and Animations:
   - Image scales up on hover for zoom effect.
   - Card translates up and shadow increases for depth.
   - Border ring appears with pink color.
   - Text slides up and subtitle fades in.
   - Shine effect animates in.

6. Call-to-Action Button:
   - At the bottom, a gradient button "View All Categories" with hover scale and shadow effects.

7. Responsiveness and Accessibility:
   - Grid adapts to screen sizes for optimal viewing.
   - Alt text on images for accessibility.
   - Smooth transitions for all interactive elements.

8. Export:
   - The component is exported as default for easy import into pages like Home.jsx.

This implementation creates a modern, interactive category showcase that enhances user engagement and reflects the luxury brand aesthetic.
