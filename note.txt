Banner.jsx Implementation Details
---------------------------------

1. Component Structure:
	- Banner.jsx is a functional React component that displays a visually striking hero/banner section for the homepage.
	- The root div uses Tailwind CSS for layout and styling, with a background image set via inline style (`backgroundImage: url('/beautybanner2.jpg')`).

2. Overlay Effect:
	- An absolutely positioned div overlays the background image, using a gradient (`bg-linear-to-br from-black/70 via-fuchsia-900/40 to-emerald-900/30`) for a modern, soft fade effect.
	- This overlay ensures text remains readable and adds depth to the design.

3. Centered Content:
	- The main content is wrapped in a relatively positioned div (`relative z-10`) to appear above the overlay.
	- Content is centered both vertically and horizontally using flexbox (`flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center`).
	- Responsive width classes (`w-full px-6 md:w-2/3 lg:w-1/2 py-12`) ensure the banner looks great on all screen sizes.

4. Typography:
	- The headline uses large, bold, white text with a drop shadow for emphasis (`text-3xl md:text-5xl font-extrabold mb-4 text-white drop-shadow-lg`).
	- The subheading uses slightly smaller, semi-transparent white text for contrast (`text-base md:text-xl mb-8 text-white/90 font-medium`).

5. Call-to-Action Buttons:
	- Two buttons are displayed side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile (`flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4`).
	- The primary button uses a pink/fuchsia gradient background (`bg-linear-to-r from-fuchsia-500 via-pink-400 to-pink-500`) and bold white text, with hover effects for interactivity.
	- The secondary button is white with fuchsia text and border, also featuring hover effects for a modern look.

6. Responsiveness & Accessibility:
	- All layout and typography classes are responsive, ensuring the banner adapts to different devices.
	- Buttons are large and easy to tap/click, with clear labels for accessibility.

7. Export:
	- The component is exported as default for easy import into the main page or layout.

This approach ensures the Banner is visually appealing, modern, and consistent with the site's branding, while remaining easy to maintain and extend.
