Orders Page Implementation:

The Orders page is a React component for managing customer orders in the admin dashboard. It features the same modern styling as other pages with glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds.

Key Components:
- Header: Gradient title 'Orders' with subtitle for order management.
- Stats Cards: Four cards showing Total Orders, Delivered, Pending, and Processing counts with icons.
- Data Table: MUI DataGrid displaying Order ID, Customer Name, Email, Status (with colored badges), and Actions (Mark as Delivered button for pending orders).
- Styling: Extensive sx props for DataGrid with high-contrast colors, centered text, hover effects, and custom scrollbar.

The page includes sample order data and supports pagination and selection. The Actions column conditionally shows a green check button for pending orders.
