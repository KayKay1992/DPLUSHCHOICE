CATEGORY CLICK → OPEN CATEGORY PRODUCTS PAGE (+ IMAGE FIX + SIDEMENU)
===================================================================

Goal
----
1) When a user clicks a category (from the Home categories section or SideMenu), open a page that shows only products in that category.
2) Fix product images on the category page so they display properly.
3) Make the SideMenu categories actually navigate to the category page and close the menu.


1) Category navigation (Routing)
--------------------------------
File: frontend/src/App.jsx

Added a dedicated category route:
- /products/category/:category

This route re-uses the existing ProductList page, but now it can receive a category slug from the URL.


2) ProductList auto-selects category from the URL
-------------------------------------------------
File: frontend/src/pages/ProductList.jsx

Change:
- Read both params from the URL:
	- searchTerm (existing)
	- category (new)

Behavior:
- When you navigate to /products/category/rings, ProductList automatically sets:
	- selectedCategory = "rings" (if it’s a valid category)
- Then it passes selectedCategory to the Products component.

Filtering logic (already existed):
- Products filters items using:
	product.categories.includes(selectedCategory)

So the category page works without creating a new page component.


3) Making the category cards clickable
--------------------------------------
File: frontend/src/components/Category.jsx

Changes:
- Each category item now has a slug (example: perfumes, body-sprays, rings, bags, etc.)
- On click, it navigates to:
	- /products/category/<slug>


4) Fixing images on the category/product list page
--------------------------------------------------
Problem:
- Some product images were getting cropped badly on the category/product list page.

Solution:
We added a flexible image display mode to the Product card.

File: frontend/src/components/Product.jsx
- Added a prop: imageFit
	- "cover"  => fills the image area (nice for Home)
	- "contain" => shows full image without aggressive cropping (better for list/category pages)

File: frontend/src/components/Products.jsx
- When rendering <Product />, we now set:
	- imageFit = "cover" on Home
	- imageFit = "contain" on non-Home pages (ProductList / category pages)

Result:
- Home page keeps the nice “full card” look.
- Category page shows cleaner product images (less cropping).


5) SideMenu improvements (Category navigation)
---------------------------------------------
File: frontend/src/components/SideMenu.jsx

Problem:
- The SideMenu displayed category items but they didn’t navigate to the category products page.

Fix:
- Added category slugs (same slugs as Category.jsx / ProductList).
- On clicking a SideMenu category:
	- navigate to /products/category/<slug>
	- automatically close the SideMenu
- Added keyboard support (Enter / Space) for accessibility.


Quick test
----------
1) Home → click a category card (e.g., Rings)
	 - Expected: opens /products/category/rings and shows only ring products
2) Open SideMenu → click a category
	 - Expected: navigates to the category page and closes the SideMenu
3) Confirm product images look better on the category page (less cropping)
